ðŸš¨ **To run a C file in a Linux Terminal/Compiler**, follow these steps:

1) `gcc [filename].c -o [filename]`: use this command to *compile the file and name the output executable (this comes in handy to avoid ambiguities)*
2) `./[filename]`: use this command to *run the compiled program*
3) `rm [filename]`: if needed, use this command to *delete the executable file*
