## 🚨 Executing Codes in Linux

The Professor uses Linux as the main terminal/compiler for the course.

If you are not familiar with it, here are some instructions for running a C file in a Linux environment:

1) `gcc [filename].c -o [filename]`: use this command to *compile and name the executable file (this also comes in handy to avoid ambiguities)*.
2) `./[filename]`: use this command to *run the executable file*.
3) `rm [filename]`: if needed, use this command to *delete the executable file*.

However, some APIs use different instructions for running these files:

- 📮 **OpenMPI**
  1) `mpicc -g -Wall -o [filename] [filename].c`: use this command to *compile the executable file*.
  2) `mpiexec -n [processes] ./[filename]`: use this command to *run the executable file* or, by adding `ddd`, to *debug the program*.
- 🧭 **OpenMP** (TBA)
- 🐌 **PThreads** (TBA)
- 🛰 **CUDA** (TBA)

## 🎬 Additional Information

- 📌 For official communications and course materials, please refer to the Moodle page of the course.
- 📩 For any questions or clarifications, feel free to contact me directly.
- 📈 The Professor will use a GitHub classroom to handle the exercises, which will be pushed and graded according to their correctness.

  **N.B.:** For this year, the grades of the exercises will **not** impact the final grade of the exam.
