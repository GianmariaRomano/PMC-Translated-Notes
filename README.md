## 🚨 Executing Codes in Linux

The Professor uses Linux as the main terminal/compiler for the course.

If you are not familiar with it, here are some instructions for running a C file in a Linux environment:

1) `gcc [filename].c -o [filename]`: use this command to *compile the file and name the output executable (this comes in handy to avoid ambiguities)*
2) `./[filename]`: use this command to *run the compiled program*
3) `rm [filename]`: if needed, use this command to *delete the executable file*
